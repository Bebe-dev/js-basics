 - Statically-typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time which means a script written in any of its language will fail to compile if it has any error. e.g Java, C, C++. While a  dynamically-typed programming language does type checking at run-time which means a script written in its language can compile even with errors that will prevent it from running properly. e.g Python, JavaScript, PHP.
 - Also, statically-typed languages require declaring the data types of your variables before you use them, while dynamically-typed languages do not.
